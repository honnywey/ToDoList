# ToDo List Web App with MongoDB, EJS, and Node.js

This project showcases the development of a dynamic ToDo List web application, designed to enhance your JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and database skills, specifically with MongoDB.

## About the Project

The **ToDo List** web app serves as a practical learning project that integrates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The main goal is to create an interactive and responsive ToDo List application that emphasizes the utilization of databases for data management.

## Features

- Interactive web interface for adding, updating, and marking tasks as complete.
- Integration of EJS for dynamic template rendering.
- Backend powered by Node.js for handling data and requests.
- Utilizes MongoDB to persist and manage task data.

## Future Enhancements

While the current focus is on functionality and database integration, future updates will concentrate on enhancing the front-end design and user experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. In the `app.js` file, update the MongoDB connection configuration to point to your desired cluster/database. Replace `sensitive.mongoDB` with the appropriate connection details.
4. Run the application with `node app.js`.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the ToDo List app.
